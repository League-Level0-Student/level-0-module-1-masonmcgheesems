//1. Complete the for loop below so that it prints out the numbers 1­10.
for( int num = 1; num < 11; num++){
System.out.println(num);

//2. Complete the for loop below so that it counts down and prints out 75 to 50.

for( int numb = 75;numb >49  ;numb--  ){

//3. Describe briefly what each part of the for loop does: 

for( a ; b ; c ){
               } 
//a) what the integer equals 
//b) how many times it loops if it is greater than or less than 
//c) if it is + it counts up or if it is - than it counts down
